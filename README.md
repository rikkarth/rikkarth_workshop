Rikkarth's Workshop

The goal of this project is to create a one page space for me to showcase my future projects. It will serve as the main-hub for the cool stuff I develop.

This landing page will be made utilising as many cool technologies as possible. It currently fashions HTML, CSS, Javascript and an industry standard animation library called GSAP.

Through the power of animation I plan to make this website one page only enabling the user to navigate through it via the power of interactive dynamic mechanisms.
